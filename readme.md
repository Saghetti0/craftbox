# CraftBox
A sandboxed microkernel for OpenComputers

Caution: CraftBox is just a proof-of-concept right now. It barely does anything useful. Inside src/box/craftbox.lua, there are a lot of commented-out debugging prints. Uncomment them to see what's actually happening internally.

## Note: CraftBox will no longer be developed. The microkenel that I will actually be working on is Quark (check my repositories).
